# ofxHersheyFont
A simple single line font for openFrameworks.

Best to be used if you want to carve/engrave text with machines like CNC-routers or lasercutters.

## Supported platforms
Tested on 
- Windows 8, OF 0.9.3.
- macOS 10.15.7, OF 0.11.0

Should work on other platforms as well.

## Additions
I added `string ofxHersheyFont::getPath_asPythonString(string stringValue, string prefix, float xPos, float yPos, float scale)` to extract the font's paths and construct a string that can be used to send a python command to my [Axidraw](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/908) plotter.
I use this function in this [example_axidraw_python_hershey](https://github.com/antimodular/examples/tree/master/example_axidraw_python_hershey).

## Credits
The Hershey Font was developed by Dr. Allen V. Hershey in 1967.

The addon contains the 'Simplex' characters of the Hershey Font (ASCII codes 32 â€“ 126), which were made available by Paul Bourke.

More recently the option to draw with [axidraw SVG fonts](https://gitlab.com/oskay/svg-fonts), including classic Hershey fonts and ESM fonts, was added.
