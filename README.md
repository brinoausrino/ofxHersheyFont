# ofxHersheyFont
A simple single line font for openFrameworks.

This version of ofxHersheyFont uses these [SVG fonts](https://gitlab.com/oskay/svg-fonts) which are provided by the excellent [Hershey Text Extension for Inkscape](https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Hershey_Text) by Evil Mad Scientist.

Best to be used if you want to carve/engrave text with machines like CNC-routers or lasercutters.

- draw them as `ofPath`

## example-python-string
- I added `string ofxHersheyFont::getPath_asPythonString(string stringValue, string prefix, float xPos, float yPos, float scale)` to extract the font's paths and construct a string that can be used to send a python command to my [Axidraw](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/908) plotter.
- I am use this function in this [example_axidraw_python_hershey](https://github.com/antimodular/examples/tree/master/example_axidraw_python_hershey).

## Supported platforms

## Credits
The Hershey Font was developed by Dr. Allen V. Hershey in 1967.

The original addon by [tobiaszimmer](https://github.com/tobiaszimmer/ofxHersheyFont) contained the 'Simplex' characters of the Hershey Font (ASCII codes 32 â€“ 126), which were made available by Paul Bourke.
